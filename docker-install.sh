#Docker installation on a Centos 7 server

#Docker is a containerization software used to create and manage containers. To use docker containers, you must first of all install Docker on your system. 

#First boot up a Centos 7 server and connect remotely to it. 

#                         INSTALLATION STEPS

#                       Clean up the system
#Make sure the system is clean by removing any old version of docker that might be installed: 

#itâ€™s ok if yum reports that none of these packages are installed
echo "Welcome to Docker installation. Please wait ...."
sleep 2

sudo yum remove docker docker-client docker-client-latest docker-common docker-latest docker-latest-logrotate docker-logrotate docker-engine

#                        Setup the docker repository
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
